### **Day 2: The Anatomy of a Commit Message**

- **Objective**: Understand the standard format of a commit message, which typically includes a short summary, an optional detailed description, and a footer. Learning this structure will help ensure your commit messages are consistent and informative.

- **Task**: Familiarize yourself with the components of a well-structured commit message and practice writing your own using this format.

- **Standard Commit Message Format**:
  1. **Short Summary** (50 characters or less):
     - A concise description of the changes made.
     - Use imperative mood (e.g., "Add," "Fix," "Update") to describe the action.
     - **Example**: `feat: add user login functionality`
  
  2. **Optional Description** (72 characters or less per line):
     - Provide additional context or details about the changes.
     - Explain why the change was made, what was affected, or any relevant background information.
     - **Example**:
       ```
       - Implemented login form
       - Added validation and error handling
       ```

  3. **Footer** (optional):
     - This section can include references to issues, pull requests, or any breaking changes.
     - **Example**: `Closes #123`

- **Examples of Well-Structured Commit Messages**:
  ```
  fix: correct navigation bug on homepage

  - Resolved issue causing incorrect routing
  - Updated links to point to the correct pages

  Closes #45
  ```

  ```
  chore: update dependencies

  - Upgraded React to version 18.0
  - Updated other dependencies to latest stable versions
  ```

- **Practice**: Write at least three commit messages for hypothetical changes, using the standard format. Ensure to include a clear summary, an optional description, and a footer if applicable.
