### **Day 9: Separate Subject and Body with a Blank Line**

- **Objective**: Learn the importance of separating the subject line from the body of the commit message with a blank line. This practice improves readability and organization of the commit history.

- **Task**: Practice formatting your commit messages correctly by ensuring there is a blank line between the subject line and the body. This will help make your commit messages clearer and more structured.

- **Why Separate with a Blank Line?**
  1. **Readability**: A blank line visually separates the summary from the details, making it easier for others (and your future self) to scan and understand the changes.
  2. **Conformity**: Many coding standards and tools (like Git) encourage this format, promoting a consistent style across projects.
  3. **Clear Structure**: It helps delineate the main point (what was done) from the explanations (why it was done), leading to clearer communication.

- **Examples of Well-Formatted Commit Messages**:
  ```
  Improve error handling for user authentication

  This change introduces more robust error handling, providing 
  users with clearer feedback on login failures. It addresses 
  issues where users received vague error messages.
  ```

  ```
  Update dependencies to resolve security vulnerabilities

  Regularly updating dependencies is crucial to maintain security 
  and stability. This update addresses known vulnerabilities in 
  the project.
  ```

- **Practice**: Rewrite the following commit messages to include a blank line separating the subject from the body:
  1. `"Fix layout issue in the footer section. This change corrects the alignment of the footer elements to ensure they display properly on all screen sizes."`
  2. `"Add pagination to product listings. Pagination improves load times and enhances user experience by preventing long scrolling."`
  3. `"Refactor database queries for performance. This optimization reduces query execution time, improving overall application performance."`

- **Example Rewrites**:
  1. ```
     Fix layout issue in the footer section

     This change corrects the alignment of the footer elements to 
     ensure they display properly on all screen sizes.
     ```

  2. ```
     Add pagination to product listings

     Pagination improves load times and enhances user experience 
     by preventing long scrolling.
     ```

  3. ```
     Refactor database queries for performance

     This optimization reduces query execution time, improving 
     overall application performance.
     ```
