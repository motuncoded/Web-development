### **Day 27: Avoid “Fixes” or “Updates” in Isolation**

- **Objective**: Understand the importance of providing context in commit messages and avoid vague terms like "Fixes" or "Updates" without additional details. Clear, informative commit messages help team members understand the changes made and their impact on the project.

- **Task**: When writing commit messages, refrain from using isolated terms like "Fixes" or "Updates." Instead, provide specific details about what was fixed or updated, why the change was necessary, and how it affects the project.

- **Why it Matters**: Vague commit messages can lead to confusion and misunderstandings about the changes made, especially in larger projects with multiple contributors. Detailed messages help document the rationale behind changes, making it easier to track down issues later and understand the project’s evolution. Clear communication is key to effective collaboration and helps maintain a cohesive team dynamic.

- **When to Use**:
  - Whenever making changes that address bugs, issues, or enhancements in the codebase.
  - When updating documentation, dependencies, or configuration files.
  - When modifying features or functionality within the application.

- **Best Practices**:
  - Include a clear summary of what was changed, along with specific references to issues or features affected.
  - Explain why the change was made and what problem it addresses or enhancement it provides.
  - Consider including relevant context, such as links to related issues or pull requests, to give reviewers a complete picture.

- **Example**:
  Instead of a vague commit message like:
  ```bash
  Fixes the user login
  ```

  Use a more descriptive message:
  ```bash
  fix: resolve login issue caused by incorrect password validation
  ```

  **Body Example**:
  - Updated the password validation logic to allow for a maximum of 20 characters.
  - Added error handling for cases where the username is not found.
  - Linked to issue #42 for reference.

By avoiding isolated terms like "Fixes" or "Updates" without context, you ensure that your commit messages provide meaningful information to your team. This practice not only enhances collaboration but also contributes to a more transparent and understandable project history, which is crucial for both current and future contributors. Clear communication through detailed commit messages leads to more effective code reviews and helps maintain the overall quality of the project.
