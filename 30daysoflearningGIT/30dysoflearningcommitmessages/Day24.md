### **Day 24: Use Verbose Commit Messages for Merges**

- **Objective**: Enhance clarity and context for merge commits by providing detailed commit messages. This practice helps document the integration of changes from different branches, making it easier for team members to understand the purpose and implications of the merge.

- **Task**: When performing a merge, write a verbose commit message that explains what changes were merged, why the merge was necessary, and any relevant context that might help others (or yourself in the future) understand the merge.

- **Why it Matters**: Merge commits can often become complex, involving contributions from multiple team members or branches. Providing a detailed message helps clarify the history of changes and the rationale behind integrating those changes. This documentation is valuable during code reviews, debugging sessions, or when revisiting the project later.

- **When to Use**:
  - Whenever you merge branches, especially if the merge involves significant changes or multiple contributors.
  - When merging feature branches back into the main branch (e.g., `main` or `develop`).
  - When integrating changes that resolve conflicts or involve substantial modifications to the codebase.

- **Best Practices**:
  - Start with a concise summary of the merge, followed by a more detailed explanation.
  - Include information about the branches being merged and the purpose of each.
  - Mention any major features, bug fixes, or issues addressed by the merge.
  - If relevant, highlight any potential impacts on existing features or known issues.

- **Example**:
  ```bash
  Merge branch 'feature/user-authentication' into 'main'
  ```

  **Body Example**:
  - Merged the `feature/user-authentication` branch into `main`.
  - This merge includes the implementation of user registration, login, and password recovery features.
  - Key changes:
    - Added user authentication routes and middleware.
    - Integrated JWT for token-based authentication.
    - Updated the database schema to include user roles.
  - Note: Some existing tests may need updates to account for the new authentication flow.

Using verbose commit messages for merges enhances the documentation of your projectâ€™s history, providing context for future reference. This clarity benefits both current team members and future contributors by making it easier to understand the rationale behind changes and the evolution of the codebase.
