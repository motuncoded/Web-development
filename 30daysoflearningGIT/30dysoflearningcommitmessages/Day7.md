### **Day 7: Use Present Tense**

- **Objective**: Understand the importance of using the present tense in commit messages. This helps convey the action being taken as a direct result of the commit, making it clear and immediate.

- **Task**: Practice writing commit messages in the present tense to enhance clarity and consistency in your version control practices.

- **Why Use Present Tense?**
  1. **Immediate Clarity**: Present tense communicates that the changes made in the commit are applicable right now. It makes the action feel current and relevant.
  2. **Consistency**: Using present tense across commit messages creates a uniform style that is easier for team members to read and understand.
  3. **Action Orientation**: It emphasizes what the commit does, rather than what has been done, keeping the focus on the effect of the change.

- **Examples of Present Tense Commit Messages**:
  - Instead of saying:
    - `"Fixed the issue with the login process"`
  - Use:
    - `"Fix the issue with the login process"`

  - Instead of:
    - `"Added new search functionality"`
  - Use:
    - `"Add new search functionality"`

- **Practice**: Rewrite the following commit messages to use the present tense:
  1. `"Removed unused variables from the code"`
  2. `"Updated dependencies to the latest versions"`
  3. `"Created a new component for user profile"`

- **Example Rewrites**:
  1. `"Remove unused variables from the code"`
  2. `"Update dependencies to the latest versions"`
  3. `"Create a new component for user profile"`
