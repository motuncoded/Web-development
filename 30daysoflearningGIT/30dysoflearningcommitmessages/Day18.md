### **Day 18: Prefix with Docs for Documentation Updates**

- **Objective**: Ensure that any changes related to documentation updates are clearly identifiable in the commit history. The goal is to make it easy for team members to differentiate between documentation changes and code changes, helping them understand the purpose of a commit without confusion.

- **Task**: Use the `docs` prefix when your changes involve updating, adding, or improving documentation. This includes modifying README files, API documentation, inline comments, or any other written resources that explain the code, project structure, or development process.

- **Why it Matters**: Documentation is critical for project maintainability, onboarding new developers, and helping users understand the software. Clear commit messages with the `docs` prefix make it easier to track improvements or corrections in documentation, without mixing them up with code changes. This distinction also highlights the importance of keeping documentation up to date alongside feature development or bug fixing.

- **When to Use**:
  - When updating the README file, contributing guidelines, or any markdown files.
  - When adding or improving comments in the code for clarity.
  - When making updates to project documentation like API docs, user manuals, or installation guides.

- **Best Practices**:
  - Keep the subject line clear and concise, using the `docs` prefix to indicate the purpose of the commit.
  - Include a description in the commit body that explains what parts of the documentation were updated and why.
  - Ensure that documentation updates reflect any recent changes in the codebase, features, or workflows.

- **Example**:
  ```bash
  docs: update installation guide for new dependencies
  ```

  **Body Example**:
  - Updated the README to reflect new dependencies required for the project.
  - Added a detailed step-by-step guide for setting up the development environment.
  - Included troubleshooting tips for common installation issues.

By prefixing documentation updates with `docs`, you help create a clearer, more maintainable project history. This makes it easier for team members or future contributors to quickly find documentation changes and ensures that project instructions remain up to date with evolving code and features.
