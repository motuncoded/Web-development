### **Day 20: Prefix with Build for Build-Related Changes**

- **Objective**: Clearly identify commits that are related to the build system or external dependencies in the commit history. This helps differentiate changes that impact how the project is built, tested, or deployed, from those that directly affect the application's code or functionality.

- **Task**: Use the `build` prefix in your commit messages when your changes involve modifying the build process, updating dependencies, or making adjustments to scripts that are involved in building the project. This can include updates to tools like Webpack, Gulp, Babel, or changes to `package.json` files.

- **Why it Matters**: Properly marking build-related changes helps maintain a clean and understandable project history, allowing developers to quickly locate and review changes that impact the build system. This is particularly important for CI/CD pipelines, deployment processes, or any updates that could affect how the project is compiled or packaged.

- **When to Use**:
  - When adding or updating dependencies in `package.json`, `yarn.lock`, or `pom.xml`.
  - When modifying build scripts, CI/CD configuration, or deployment pipelines.
  - When changing how the project is compiled or bundled (e.g., Webpack configuration updates).
  - When upgrading or downgrading versions of build-related tools (e.g., Babel, ESLint, TypeScript).

- **Best Practices**:
  - Use the `build` prefix to keep build-related changes separate from other updates like features or bug fixes.
  - Provide details in the commit body about what specific changes were made, why they were necessary, and any potential impacts (e.g., new dependency versions, removed libraries).
  - Ensure that build-related changes are tested to avoid breaking the deployment or build process.

- **Example**:
  ```bash
  build: update Webpack to version 5
  ```

  **Body Example**:
  - Upgraded Webpack from version 4 to 5 to take advantage of improved bundling performance.
  - Updated the Webpack configuration to comply with new syntax and plugin requirements.
  - Verified that the project builds correctly with the updated configuration.

By prefixing build-related commits with `build`, you help your team quickly understand the nature of changes related to the project's development environment, without confusing them with code features or bug fixes. This also makes it easier to troubleshoot issues related to the build process.
