### Day 2: Setting Up the Environment

#### Overview
Before diving deeper into JavaScript, it's important to set up the right development environment for writing, testing, and debugging JavaScript code effectively.

#### Objectives
- Set up a code editor for JavaScript development.
- Learn how to include JavaScript in an HTML file.
- Understand how to use the browser's developer tools for debugging.
- Get familiar with using `console.log()` for testing your code.

#### Key Concepts

1. **Code Editor**:
   - You need a code editor that supports JavaScript. Popular choices include:
     - **VS Code** (Visual Studio Code): Free, with a wide range of extensions for JavaScript development.
     - **Sublime Text**: Lightweight editor with support for multiple languages.
     - **Atom**: Open-source editor created by GitHub.
   - **Task**: Download and install VS Code or your preferred editor.
   
2. **Including JavaScript in HTML**:
   - JavaScript can be embedded directly in HTML or linked as an external file.
   
   **Inline JavaScript**:
   ```html
   <script>
     console.log('Hello from inline script');
   </script>
   ```

   **External JavaScript**:
   ```html
   <!-- Link to an external JavaScript file -->
   <script src="app.js"></script>
   ```
   **Task**: Create an HTML file and link an external JavaScript file.

3. **Browser Developer Tools**:
   - Every modern browser comes with built-in developer tools. These tools help debug JavaScript, inspect elements, and monitor network activity.
     - **Open Developer Tools**:
       - **Google Chrome**: Right-click > Inspect > Console
       - **Firefox**: Right-click > Inspect Element > Console
     - Use the **Console** tab to view JavaScript errors and outputs.
     - **Task**: Open the developer tools in your browser and use `console.log()` to display messages.

4. **Debugging with `console.log()`**:
   - You can print values and messages to the console for quick debugging.
   ```javascript
   console.log('This is a test message');
   var number = 10;
   console.log('The number is', number);
   ```
   - **Task**: Experiment with different `console.log()` outputs to observe how it helps with debugging.

#### Setting Up a Project

**Step 1: Create a Folder for Your Project**:
- Create a new folder on your computer for JavaScript projects (e.g., `js-projects`).

**Step 2: Create an HTML File**:
- Inside the folder, create an `index.html` file with this structure:
  ```html
  <!DOCTYPE html>
  <html lang="en">
  <head>
      <meta charset="UTF-8">
      <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
      <title>JavaScript Environment Setup</title>
      <script src="app.js"></script> <!-- Link to the external JS file -->
  </head>
  <body>
      <h1>JavaScript Environment Setup</h1>
  </body>
  </html>
  ```

**Step 3: Create a JavaScript File**:
- In the same folder, create an `app.js` file:
  ```javascript
  console.log('JavaScript is successfully linked!');
  ```

**Step 4: Open the HTML File in Your Browser**:
- Open the `index.html` file in your browser and check the console for the message.

- **Developer Tools Overview**: [MDN - Browser DevTools](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Common_questions/What_are_browser_developer_tools)
- **VS Code Installation**: [VS Code - Setup](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/setup/setup-overview)

#### Task
- Set up your development environment.
- Write a simple JavaScript program that logs a message to the browser's console.
