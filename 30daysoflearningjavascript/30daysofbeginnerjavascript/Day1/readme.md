### Day 1: What is JavaScript?

#### Overview
JavaScript is a versatile, high-level programming language that is primarily used to create interactive and dynamic content on the web. It is one of the core technologies of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and CSS.

#### Objectives
- Understand the purpose and capabilities of JavaScript.
- Learn about its role in web development.
- Familiarize yourself with basic JavaScript syntax and structure.

#### Key Concepts

1. **Dynamic Behavior**: 
   - JavaScript allows you to implement complex features on web pages, such as interactive forms, animations, and real-time updates.

2. **Client-Side vs. Server-Side**:
   - **Client-Side**: JavaScript is executed in the user's browser, enabling real-time interactions without needing to communicate with the server.
   - **Server-Side**: JavaScript can also be used on the server with environments like Node.js, allowing for full-stack development.

3. **Event-Driven Programming**: 
   - JavaScript is event-driven, meaning it can respond to user actions (like clicks and key presses) to trigger specific behaviors on a webpage.

4. **Syntax Basics**:
   - JavaScript uses a syntax similar to other programming languages, with variables, functions, loops, and conditionals.
   - **Example**:
     ```javascript
     // This is a simple JavaScript program
     var greeting = "Hello, world!";
     console.log(greeting);
     ```

#### Learning Resources
- **Documentation**: [Mozilla Developer Network (MDN) JavaScript Guide](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide)
- **Interactive Learning**: Websites like Codecademy or freeCodeCamp offer hands-on JavaScript courses.

#### Task
- Set up a basic HTML file and include a simple JavaScript snippet that displays a greeting message in the browser's console.

**Example HTML Structure**:
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>JavaScript Introduction</title>
    <script>
        // JavaScript code goes here
        console.log("Hello, world!");
    </script>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Welcome to JavaScript!</h1>
</body>
</html>
```

By the end of Day 1, you should have a fundamental understanding of what JavaScript is and how it can be used to enhance web development.
