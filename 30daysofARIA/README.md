# 30 Days of ARIA for Accessibility

Welcome to the **30 Days of ARIA for Accessibility** challenge! This plan is designed to help you master ARIA (Accessible Rich Internet Applications) to create inclusive and accessible web content using HTML.

## Overview

ARIA attributes are essential for enhancing web accessibility, especially for users who rely on assistive technologies such as screen readers. This challenge focuses on integrating ARIA effectively into your HTML for better accessibility.

### What You'll Learn:

- The purpose of ARIA attributes.
- How to implement ARIA roles, properties, and states.
- Common ARIA patterns for web components.
- Ensuring compatibility with assistive technologies.
