# Day 4: Working with Lists in HTML

## Concepts and Explanation
On **Day 4**, we will explore how to create and work with lists in HTML. Lists are a fundamental part of HTML that allow you to group related items together, making it easier to present information in an organized manner.

### 1. Types of Lists
HTML supports three main types of lists:

1. **Unordered Lists (`<ul>`)**: A list that does not have a specific order. Items are typically displayed with bullet points.
2. **Ordered Lists (`<ol>`)**: A list where the items are numbered, indicating a specific order.
3. **Definition Lists (`<dl>`)**: A list used to define terms and their descriptions.

## Key Elements

### 1. Unordered Lists (`<ul>`)
An unordered list is created using the `<ul>` tag. Each item in the list is enclosed within `<li>` (list item) tags.

Example:
```html
<ul>
    <li>Item 1</li>
    <li>Item 2</li>
    <li>Item 3</li>
</ul>
```

### 2. Ordered Lists (`<ol`>)
An ordered list is created using the `<ol>` tag. Similar to unordered lists, each item is also enclosed within `<li>` tags.

Example:

```html
<ol>
    <li>First Item</li>
    <li>Second Item</li>
    <li>Third Item</li>
</ol>
```

### 3. Definition Lists (<dl>)
A definition list is created using the <dl> tag. Each term is defined using <dt> (definition term) and its description using <dd> (definition description).

Example:

```html
<dl>
    <dt>HTML</dt>
    <dd>Hypertext Markup Language</dd>
    <dt>CSS</dt>
    <dd>Cascading Style Sheets</dd>
</dl>
```
