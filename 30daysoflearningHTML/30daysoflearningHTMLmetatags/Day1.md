### **Day 1: Introduction to Meta Tags**

- **Objective**:  
  Gain a foundational understanding of what meta tags are, their purpose in web development, and how they influence web pages behind the scenes. You will learn how meta tags impact SEO (Search Engine Optimization), page performance, and how information is communicated to browsers and search engines.

- **What are Meta Tags?**  
  Meta tags are snippets of text that describe a webpage's content; they are placed inside the `<head>` element of an HTML document. Meta tags don’t appear on the page itself but are part of the page’s code. They serve various purposes, such as:
  - **SEO**: Meta tags, like the description and keywords, help search engines understand what your site is about, improving your visibility in search results.
  - **Viewport and Responsive Design**: Meta tags control how content is scaled on different devices, especially mobile, improving user experience across devices.
  - **Character Encoding**: Setting character encoding using a meta tag ensures that special characters display correctly.

  Common meta tags include:
  1. **Meta Charset**: Defines the character encoding used (e.g., UTF-8).
     ```html
     <meta charset="UTF-8">
     ```
  2. **Meta Description**: Provides a brief description of the webpage, shown in search results.
     ```html
     <meta name="description" content="Learn the fundamentals of meta tags in HTML for better SEO and responsive design.">
     ```
  3. **Viewport Meta Tag**: Ensures your webpage scales well on mobile devices.
     ```html
     <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
     ```

- **Why It’s Important**:  
  Meta tags are crucial for communicating non-visual information about your website. They help search engines properly index your site, ensure that your page is displayed correctly on all devices, and improve accessibility. Without proper use of meta tags, your site might rank lower on search engines or have display issues on mobile devices.
