# Day 2: Headings, Paragraphs, and Line Breaks

## Concepts and Explanation
On **Day 2**, we explore how to structure text using headings, paragraphs, and line breaks in HTML. These elements are essential for organizing content and ensuring it's displayed correctly on a webpage.

### 1. Headings (`<h1>` to `<h6>`)
Headings define the importance and structure of your content. HTML provides six levels of headings:
- **`<h1>`**: The most important heading, used for the main title of the page.
- **`<h2>`** to **`<h6>`**: Subheadings for organizing content, each progressively smaller.

### 2. Paragraphs (`<p>`)
The `<p>` tag defines a block of text as a paragraph. It's a block-level element that automatically adds space before and after the text, making it easier to read.

### 3. Line Breaks (`<br>`)
The `<br>` tag is used to force a line break within a paragraph without starting a new one. This tag is self-closing and doesn't need a closing tag.

## Key Elements
- **`<h1>` to `<h6>`**: Defines heading levels from the most important (`<h1>`) to the least important (`<h6>`).
- **`<p>`**: Defines a paragraph of text.
- **`<br>`**: Inserts a line break within a paragraph.

### Accessibility Best Practices
- Use headings (<h1> to <h6>) in a hierarchical order. For example, `<h1>` is the main title, followed by `<h2>`, and so on.
- Avoid skipping heading levels (e.g., jumping from `<h1>` to `<h3>`).
- Use only one <h1> per page to indicate the main heading.
- Use `<p>` to group related sentences or ideas.
- Avoid using empty paragraphs for spacing (use CSS margins or padding instead).
- Ensure that each paragraph conveys a complete idea for better comprehension.
