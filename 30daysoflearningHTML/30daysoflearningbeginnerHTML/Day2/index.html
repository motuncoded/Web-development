    <p>
      This is a paragraph of text under the main heading. Paragraphs contain
      blocks of text and automatically add space before and after themselves.
    </p>

    <h2>Subheading (h2)</h2>
    <p>
      This is another paragraph under the second-level heading. This helps to
      break up the content and improve readability.
    </p>

    <h3>Sub-subheading (h3)</h3>
    <p>
      You can add more subheadings to organize content in a logical structure.
      Notice how each heading becomes smaller in size.
    </p>

    <p>
      This paragraph uses a line break.<br />Here is the second line of the same
      paragraph after the break.
    </p>
    <h1>Main Heading (h1)</h1>

    <h4>Subheading (h4)</h4>
    <p>More content goes here, under an even smaller subheading.</p>

    <h5>Subheading (h5)</h5>
    <p>Subheadings continue to shrink as you use lower-level heading tags.</p>

    <h6>Subheading (h6)</h6>
    <p>This is the smallest heading level in HTML.</p>
  </body>
