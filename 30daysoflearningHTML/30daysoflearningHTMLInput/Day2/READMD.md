### Day 2: Password Input

Welcome to Day 2! Today, you will focus on the **Password Input** field, which is essential for user authentication forms. Understanding how to implement and manage password fields will enhance the security and usability of your web forms.

---

#### Goals for Day 2:

- Understand the basic structure of a password input field.
- Learn how to implement attributes specific to password inputs.
- Explore security considerations for password fields.
- Implement styling and accessibility best practices.

---

#### 1. Basic Structure of a Password Input

A password input field is created using the `<input>` element with the `type` attribute set to `password`. This ensures that the characters entered by the user are obscured, enhancing security.

Here’s a simple example:

```html
<form>
  <label for="password">Password:</label>
  <input type="password" id="password" name="password" required />
</form>
```

In this example:

- The `required` attribute indicates that this field must be filled out before the form can be submitted.

---

#### 2. Implementing Attributes for Password Inputs

Password input fields can have several useful attributes that improve user experience and security:

- **`minlength`**: Sets a minimum length for the password.
- **`maxlength`**: Limits the maximum number of characters that can be entered.
- **`pattern`**: Specifies a regular expression that the password must match (e.g., at least one uppercase letter, one number, etc.).
- **`autocomplete`**: Suggests the browser’s autocomplete feature to help users fill in the password field.
- **`show password toggle`**: Allows users to view the password they are entering.

Example:

```html
<form>
  <label for="password">Password:</label>
  <input
    type="password"
    id="password"
    name="password"
    required
    minlength="8"
    pattern="(?=.*\d)(?=.*[a-z])(?=.*[A-Z]).{8,}"
  />
</form>
```

#### 3. Security Considerations for Password Inputs

When handling passwords, it’s essential to prioritize security:

- **Use Strong Password Policies**: Encourage users to create strong passwords by requiring a mix of upper and lower case letters, numbers, and special characters.
- **Implement Password Visibility Toggle**: Allow users to see the password they are typing, which can help prevent errors.

Example of a password visibility toggle:

```html
<label for="password">Password:</label>
<input type="password" id="password" name="password" required />
<button type="button" id="togglePassword">Show</button>

<script>
  const togglePassword = document.getElementById("togglePassword");
  const passwordInput = document.getElementById("password");

  togglePassword.addEventListener("click", function () {
    const type =
      passwordInput.getAttribute("type") === "password" ? "text" : "password";
    passwordInput.setAttribute("type", type);
    this.textContent = type === "password" ? "Show" : "Hide";
  });
</script>
```

#### 4. Styling Password Inputs

You can style password input fields similarly to text inputs, ensuring they are user-friendly and visually appealing.

Example CSS:

```css
input[type="password"] {
  width: 100%; /* Full width */
  padding: 10px; /* Add padding */
  border: 1px solid #ccc; /* Light gray border */
  border-radius: 4px; /* Rounded corners */
  font-size: 16px; /* Font size */
}

input[type="password"]:focus {
  border-color: #005fcc; /* Change border color on focus */
  outline: none; /* Remove default outline */
}
```

---

#### 5. Accessibility Considerations

To ensure accessibility for all users, follow these best practices:

- **Use Labels**: Always provide `<label>` elements associated with password inputs.
- **Error Handling**: Clearly indicate if the password does not meet the required criteria.
- **Keyboard Accessibility**: Ensure users can navigate to the password field using the keyboard.

Example of an accessible password input with error messaging:

```html
<form id="signupForm">
  <label for="password">Password:</label>
  <input
    type="password"
    id="password"
    name="password"
    required
    aria-required="true"
  />
  <p id="passwordError" class="error-message" aria-live="polite"></p>
  <button type="submit">Submit</button>
</form>
```

#### Task for Today

1. Create a simple HTML form with a password input field.
2. Implement various attributes (e.g., `minlength`, `pattern`).
3. Add a password visibility toggle feature.
4. Apply basic CSS styling to enhance the appearance of your password input.
5. Ensure that your form is accessible by using proper labels and error handling.
