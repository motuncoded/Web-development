### Key Elements
1. Embedding Images

The `<img>` tag is used to embed images in an HTML document.
Syntax:
```html
<img src="image-url" alt="description of image">
```
**Attributes**:
- src: Specifies the path to the image file.
- alt: Provides alternative text for screen readers and displays when the image cannot be loaded.

**Image Formats**

- JPEG (.jpg): Best for photographs and images with many colors. Supports lossy compression.
- PNG (.png): Supports transparency and lossless compression. Ideal for images requiring transparency and for simple graphics.
- SVG (.svg): Scalable vector graphics that are resolution-independent. Great for logos and icons.

**Accessibility**

Adding alt text is essential for accessibility. It helps visually impaired users understand the content of images through screen readers.
