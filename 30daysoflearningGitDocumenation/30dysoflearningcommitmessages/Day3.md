### **Day 3: Use Imperative Mood**

- **Objective**: Learn the importance of using imperative mood in commit messages. This helps create a consistent tone and clearly indicates the actions being taken in the codebase.

- **Task**: Practice writing commit messages using the imperative mood. This will improve the clarity of your messages and make them more actionable.

- **What is Imperative Mood?**
  - The imperative mood is a grammatical mood used to express commands, requests, or instructions. In the context of commit messages, it instructs the reader on what the commit does.
  - Instead of describing what has been done, you state what the commit **does**.

- **Examples of Imperative Mood**:
  - Instead of saying:
    - `"Added user authentication feature"`
  - Use:
    - `"Add user authentication feature"`

  - Instead of:
    - `"Fixed typo in the README file"`
  - Use:
    - `"Fix typo in the README file"`

- **Benefits of Using Imperative Mood**:
  1. **Clarity**: It makes the purpose of the commit clear and direct.
  2. **Consistency**: Creates a uniform style across commit messages, making them easier to read and understand.
  3. **Action-Oriented**: Focuses on what the code does rather than what was done, which can be more relevant for collaborators reviewing the history.

- **Practice**: Rewrite the following commit messages to use the imperative mood:
  1. `"Updated the API documentation"`
  2. `"Implemented feature for user profile management"`
  3. `"Refactored the code for better readability"`

- **Example Rewrites**:
  1. `"Update API documentation"` 
  2. `"Implement feature for user profile management"`
  3. `"Refactor code for better readability"`
