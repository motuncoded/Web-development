### **Day 30: Final Project**

- **Objective**: Apply all the commit message best practices learned over the past month in a final project. This exercise will reinforce your understanding of effective commit messaging and help you solidify these practices into your regular workflow.

- **Task**: Create or contribute to a project using Git, and focus on writing meaningful, clear, and informative commit messages throughout the development process. Document your journey and highlight how you applied each of the commit message principles you've learned.

- **Why it Matters**: The final project serves as a practical application of the knowledge gained during the past 30 days. By integrating these practices into your workflow, you will improve collaboration within your team and enhance the overall quality of your project’s commit history.

- **Steps to Follow**:
  1. **Choose a Project**: Select a new or existing project where you can apply the commit message best practices. This could be a personal project, a collaborative team project, or an open-source contribution.
  
  2. **Plan Your Commits**: Before starting, outline the major features, bug fixes, or changes you plan to implement. Consider how you will structure your commits and what messages will best convey the purpose and context of each change.

     - Provide context in the commit body.
     - Avoid vague terms and be specific about what you changed and why.
  
  4. **Review Your Commit History**: After completing the project, review your commit history. Reflect on how well you adhered to the best practices and identify areas for improvement.
  
  5. **Document Your Experience**: Write a brief summary of your experience throughout the project. Highlight any challenges you faced and how applying the commit message principles helped improve your workflow and communication with your team.
