### **Day 17: Prefix with Test for Adding or Modifying Tests**

- **Task**: When committing changes that involve adding, modifying, or improving test cases, use the `test` prefix. This helps to clearly differentiate testing-related commits from those related to features, bug fixes, or other types of updates. Test commits help improve the project's quality by ensuring functionality is validated or regressions are caught.

- **Why it Matters**: By explicitly marking changes related to tests, other developers and reviewers can easily identify that the commit is related to the testing process and not directly to the application's behavior. This is particularly helpful when reviewing a project’s history, investigating test failures, or ensuring new features are thoroughly tested.

- **Example**:
  ```bash
  test: add unit tests for user authentication
  ```

  **Body Exa### **Day 17: Prefix with Test for Adding or Modifying Tests**

- **Objective**: Ensure that any changes related to testing, such as adding new test cases or modifying existing ones, are clearly identifiable in the project’s commit history. The goal is to improve code quality, prevent regressions, and make the codebase easier to maintain by explicitly labeling testing efforts.

- **Task**: Use the `test` prefix in your commit messages when committing changes that involve adding, updating, or modifying tests. This provides transparency in your commit history, making it easier for others to understand the nature of the commit at a glance.

- **Why it Matters**: Well-structured tests help prevent bugs, ensure that new features don’t break existing functionality, and improve the overall reliability of your application. By using the `test` prefix, teams can quickly locate commits related to testing, which is crucial during debugging, refactoring, or when reviewing how a feature has been tested.

  Additionally, commits focused on testing demonstrate that the code has been thoroughly validated. This helps both current and future contributors understand the code’s robustness and coverage.

- **When to Use**:
  - When adding new test cases (e.g., unit tests, integration tests, or end-to-end tests).
  - When fixing or improving existing tests.
  - When refactoring tests for better coverage or structure.

- **Best Practices**:
  - Keep the subject line clear and concise, using the `test` prefix to indicate the purpose of the commit.
  - Include a detailed explanation in the commit body, describing the functionality covered, the type of test added or modified, and any edge cases handled.

- **Example**:
  ```bash
  test: add unit tests for user authentication
  ```

  **Body Example**:
  - Added unit tests to cover the user authentication process, including scenarios for valid and invalid login attempts.
  - Tested both successful logins and cases where users enter incorrect credentials.
  - Ensured proper validation and error messages for incorrect input.
  
This labeling improves collaboration, helps track testing efforts, and provides clarity in the project history. By marking commits with `test`, you emphasize the importance of testing and ensure that future reviewers know exactly which changes are focused on validation rather than features or bug fixes.mple**:
  - Added unit tests to verify the login form's behavior under various conditions.
  - Ensured that validation errors are correctly triggered for invalid input.
  - Confirmed that a valid user can successfully log in without errors.

Using this convention improves collaboration and clarity, especially on teams where testing is a key aspect of the development process.
