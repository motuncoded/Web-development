### **Day 6: Skip the Period in the Subject Line**

- **Objective**: Understand the convention of omitting periods at the end of commit message subject lines. This practice contributes to a cleaner and more consistent commit history.

- **Task**: Learn why itâ€™s recommended to skip the period in the subject line and practice formatting your commit messages accordingly.

- **Why Skip the Period?**
  1. **Consistency**: Many developers and teams adopt the practice of not using periods, which helps maintain a uniform style in commit messages.
  2. **Clarity**: Since commit messages are often displayed in lists (like when using `git log`), having a period can make them look cluttered or inconsistent.
  3. **Simplification**: By omitting periods, you simplify the structure of the message, focusing on the action rather than punctuation.

- **Example of a Well-Formatted Commit Message**:
  ```
  Update README for installation instructions
  ```

  **Poor Example**:
  ```
  Update README for installation instructions.
  ```

- **Best Practices**:
  - Keep your subject line concise and informative without adding unnecessary punctuation.
  - Focus on clarity and action when writing your commit message.

- **Practice**: Rewrite the following commit messages to omit the period at the end:
  1. `"Fix bugs in user profile feature."`
  2. `"Add tests for new API endpoints."`
  3. `"Refactor code for better performance."`

- **Example Rewrites**:
  1. `"Fix bugs in user profile feature"`
  2. `"Add tests for new API endpoints"`
  3. `"Refactor code for better performance"`
