### **Day 13: Prefix with Feat for New Features**

- **Objective**: Learn the importance of prefixing commit messages with "feat" when introducing new features in your codebase. This practice helps maintain clarity and consistency in the commit history.

- **Task**: Practice identifying and writing commit messages for new features using the "feat" prefix in accordance with the Conventional Commits specification.

- **Why Use "feat"?**
  1. **Clarity**: Prefixing with "feat" clearly indicates that the commit introduces a new feature, making it easy for team members to identify the purpose of the change.
  2. **Organized History**: It helps in maintaining a well-organized commit history, which is especially useful for automated tools that generate changelogs or manage versioning.
  3. **Facilitates Collaboration**: When working in a team, using standard prefixes promotes better understanding among developers regarding the nature of changes.

- **Structure of a "feat" Commit Message**:
  ```
  feat(<scope>): <description>
  ```

- **Examples of "feat" Commit Messages**:
  - ```
    feat(user): add user profile page
    ```
  - ```
    feat(search): implement search functionality for products
    ```

- **Practice**: Rewrite the following commit messages to include the "feat" prefix where applicable:
  1. `"Create a new dashboard for user analytics."`
  2. `"Add option to filter products by category."`
  3. `"Improve styling on the checkout page."` (Note: This is a style change, not a new feature)

- **Example Rewrites**:
  1. ```
     feat(analytics): create a new dashboard for user analytics
     ```

  2. ```
     feat(filter): add option to filter products by category
     ```

  3. ```
     style(checkout): improve styling on the checkout page
     ```
