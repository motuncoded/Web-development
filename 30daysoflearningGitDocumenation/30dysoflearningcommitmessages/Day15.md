### **Day 15: Prefix with Chore for Maintenance**

- **Objective**: Understand the importance of prefixing commit messages with "chore" for maintenance tasks and updates that do not affect the functionality of the application. This practice helps maintain clarity and consistency in the commit history.

- **Task**: Practice writing commit messages for maintenance tasks using the "chore" prefix in accordance with the Conventional Commits specification.

- **Why Use "chore"?**
  1. **Clarity**: Prefixing with "chore" clearly indicates that the commit is related to routine maintenance or updates rather than new features or bug fixes.
  2. **Organized History**: It contributes to a well-organized commit history, allowing team members to easily identify non-functional changes and maintenance efforts.
  3. **Facilitates Collaboration**: Using standardized prefixes improves communication among developers regarding the nature of maintenance tasks.

- **Structure of a "chore" Commit Message**:
  ```
  chore(<scope>): <description>
  ```

- **Examples of "chore" Commit Messages**:
  - ```
    chore(deps): update project dependencies to latest versions
    ```
  - ```
    chore(tests): add missing configuration files for test environment
    ```

- **Practice**: Rewrite the following commit messages to include the "chore" prefix where applicable:
  1. `"Update README file for better clarity."`
  2. `"Refactor build configuration for optimization."`
  3. `"Add ESLint configuration for code linting."`

- **Example Rewrites**:
  1. ```
     chore(docs): update README file for better clarity
     ```

  2. ```
     chore(build): refactor build configuration for optimization
     ```

  3. ```
     chore(lint): add ESLint configuration for code linting
     ```

This structured approach will help reinforce the practice of prefixing commit messages with "chore" for maintenance tasks. Let me know if you need any further adjustments!
