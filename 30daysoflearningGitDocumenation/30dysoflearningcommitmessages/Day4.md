### **Day 4: Limit the Subject Line to 50 Characters**

- **Objective**: Improve your ability to write clear and concise subject lines by practicing a strict character limit of 50 characters. This exercise will help you focus on the most important information and eliminate unnecessary words.

- **Task**: Write a series of subject lines for different scenarios, ensuring each one does not exceed 50 characters. Use active language and be specific about the action or content.

- **Tips for Writing Effective Subject Lines**:
  1. **Be Specific**: Clearly indicate what the email is about.
  2. **Use Action Verbs**: Start with a verb to convey action.
  3. **Avoid Jargon**: Use simple language that everyone can understand.
  4. **Consider the Audience**: Tailor your subject line to the recipient’s understanding and needs.
  5. **Test Variations**: Try different phrasings to see which is most effective.

- **Examples**:
  - `"Update project deadline to next Friday"`
  - `"Send feedback on design draft by Monday"`
  - `"Request approval for budget increase"`
  - `"Schedule meeting to discuss project goals"`

- **Practice**: Write at least five subject lines for different contexts (e.g., project updates, meeting requests, feedback, etc.), ensuring each is clear and within the 50-character limit.
